# Making a texture great again

_"The making a one-off tool"_

This tool was created as a one-off utility to warp a face-mask, a maori face tatto. It was later presented and shared at CocoaHeads Stockholm meetup #74.

Usage, move the green corners to fitting positions then press cmd-B and warp the image by moving the red corners.

Have fun!
